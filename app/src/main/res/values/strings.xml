    <string name="adviceone">Unlike mortgages or a credit card, you can usually get a car loan even if you have pretty bad credit—you’ll just pay (a lot) more since banks can easily repossess the car</string>
    <string name="advicetwo">Try online lenders. You complete a credit application and are presented with your interest rate and a max amount you can spend. </string>
    <string name="advicethree">Shorter loan terms come with lower interest rates but higher monthly payments. And that’s what you want.</string>
    <string name="advicefour">In addition to a short loan term, you can avoid a situation in which you owe more money than the car is worth by putting money down.</string>
    <string name="advicefive">Do not finance the miscellaneous expenses involved in your vehicle purchase like extended warranties.</string>
